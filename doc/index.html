    <h1>PCall</h1>

    <p>PCall, or parallel call, is a Common Lisp library intended to
    simplify 'result-oriented' parallelism. It uses a thread pool to
    concurrently run small computations without spawning a new thread.
    This makes it possible to exploit multiple cores without much
    extra fuss.</p>

    <h2 id="quickstart">Quickstart</h2>

    <p>PCall is a rather simple library. There are only three basic
    concepts that you have to come to grips with:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The thread pool, which mostly manages itself, but whose
      existence you should be aware of. It starts inactive, but as
      soon as a task is created, it is initialised. See <a
      href="#thread-pool-size"><code>thread-pool-size</code></a> and
      <a href="#finish-tasks"><code>finish-tasks</code></a> for ways
      in which it can be managed.</li>

      <li>Creating tasks, done through <a
      href="#pcall"><code>pcall</code></a> and <a
      href="#pexec"><code>pexec</code></a>. This creates a computation
      that may be parallelised, and enqueues it. When given the
      chance, the threads in the thread pool will take such a task,
      execute it, and store its result.</li>

      <li>Joining tasks (<a href="#join"><code>join</code></a>), which
      extracts the value from a computation. This blocks when the task
      is still running. If it has not yet started, the joining thread
      will claim and execute the task itself.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Imagine that we have this wonderful algorithm for computing
    (once again) Fibonnaci numbers:</p>

    <pre class="code">
(defun fib (n)
  (if (> n 2)
      (+ (fib (- n 1)) (fib (- n 2)))
      1))

(time (fib 40))</pre>

    <p>Depending on your machine, this might take some 2 to 10
    seconds. We don't have that kind of patience. You can see that
    this algorithm is entirely optimal, so our only option, it seems,
    is to use more hardware &#x2015; or make better use of the
    hardware we have:</p>

    <pre class="code">
(time (let ((f39 (pexec (fib 39)))
            (f38 (pexec (fib 38))))
        (+ (join f39) (join f38))))</pre>

    <p>On my 2-core machine, that speeds things up by about a third
    &#x2015; which makes sense, since computing fib(39) is about twice
    as much work as computing fib(38). A nicer way to write the same
    thing is:</p>

    <pre class="code">
(time (plet ((f39 (fib 39))
             (f38 (fib 38)))
        (+ f39 f38)))</pre>

    <p><a href="#plet"><code>plet</code></a> takes care of the
    wrapping and joining in cases like this. Why do we need the let
    anyway? You could try this:</p>

    <pre class="code">
(time (+ (join (pexec (fib 39))) (join (pexec (fib 38)))))</pre>

    <p>... but that won't buy you anything. The tasks have to both be
    created before you join the first one, or the second task will not
    exist when the first one runs, and thus won't be able to run
    concurrently with it.</p>

    <p>You might be tempted to write something like this:</p>

    <pre class="code">
(defun pfib (n)
  (if (> n 2)
      (plet ((a (pfib (- n 1)))
             (b (pfib (- n 2))))
        (+ a b))
      1))</pre>

    <p>... but don't. There is some overhead associated with creating
    and executing tasks, and for a function like naive-fibonacci,
    which recurses a zillion times even for small inputs, this will
    radically slow your algorithm down. A parallel mapping function,
    as shown below, works great for mapping a relatively heavy
    function over a list of limited length, but is no use for mapping
    <code>1+</code> over a million elements.</p>

    <pre class="code">
(defun pmapcar (f list)
  (let ((result (mapcar (lambda (n) (pexec (funcall f n))) list)))
    (map-into result #'join result)))

(defvar *numbers* (loop :for i :from 0 :below 30 :collect i))
(time (mapcar #'fib i))
(time (pmapcar #'fib i))</pre>

    <p>Note that joining tasks is not required. When you do not care
    about the result of a computation, you can just spawn the task and
    leave it at that.</p>

    <p>As a final note, PCall can also be used when a program is not
    CPU-bound, but needs to do some tasks that are hampered by other
    bottlenecks (network latency, disk speed). If they can be executed
    in parallel, you can have the thread pool run them. In the
    following example, the second version runs three times faster on
    my machine:</p>

    <pre class="code">
(defvar *urls* '("http://marijn.haverbeke.nl/pcall" "http://common-lisp.net"
                 "http://eloquentjavascript.net" "http://xkcd.com"))

(time (mapc 'drakma:http-request *urls*))
(time (mapc 'join (mapcar (lambda (url) (pexec (drakma:http-request url))) *urls*)))</pre>

    <p>In some applications, doing multiple database queries at the
    same time could really help. You might need to increase the size
    of the thread pool in such a situation, since some threads will be
    sitting idle, waiting on a socket.</p>

    <p class="desc">Follows the behaviour of <code>let</code>, but
    wraps every bound value into a <a
    href="#pexec"><code>pexec</code></a> form, and automatically adds
    <a href="#join"><code>join</code></a> calls around uses of the
    bound variables.</p>

    <p class="def" id="join">
      <span>function</span>
      join (task)
      <br/>&#8594; result
    </p>

    <p class="desc">Waits for the given task to finish, and then
    returns any values the task produced. When executing the task
    raised an uncaught error, this error will be raised when joining
    the task. (Note that this re-raising might cause problems with
    condition handlers, which might not be active in the worker
    threads. If you are using handlers, take extra care, and look at
    <a
    href="#set-worker-environment"><code>set-worker-environment</code></a>.)
    When, at the moment <code>join</code> is called, the task has not
    been assigned to any thread, the joining thread will execute the
    task itself. (Note that this makes the dynamic environment in
    which the task runs unpredictable.) A task may be joined multiple
    times. Subsequent joins will again return the values, without
    re-executing the task.</p>

    <p class="def" id="select-one">
      <span>function</span>

      <span>function</span>
      thread-pool-size ()

    <p class="desc">Returns the current size of the thread pool. Also
    supports <code>setf</code> to change this size. The default value
    is <code>3</code>.</p>

    <p class="def" id="set-worker-environment">
      <span>function</span>
      set-worker-environment (wrapper)
    </p>

    <p class="desc">This can be used to make dynamic variables or
    bound handlers available in the worker threads.
    <code>wrapper</code> should be either <code>nil</code>, for no
    wrapping, or a function that, given a function argument, calls its
    argument in the new environment. Works best with <a
    href="#with-local-thread-pool">local</a> thead pools.</p>

    <p class="def" id="finish-tasks">
      <span>function</span>
      finish-tasks ()
    </p>

    <p class="desc">Takes the current threads out of the pool, waits
    for the task queue to empty, and then for the threads to finish
    executing any tasks they might be busy with. This is intended to
    be called when shutting down &#x2015; killing the threads might
    cause some tasks to be aborted, which could result in data loss.
    If you join every task you create, this should not be necessary.
    Note that if you call this function while other threads are still
    creating tasks, it might never return.</p>

      <span>macro</span>
      with-local-thread-pool (&amp;key size on-unwind worker-environment)

    <p class="desc">Run <code>body</code> with a fresh thread pool. If
    <code>on-unwind</code> is <code>:wait</code> (the default), the
    form will wait for all local tasks to finish before returning. If
    it is <code>:leave</code>, it will return while threads are still
    working. Given <code>:stop</code> or <code>:destroy</code>, the
    threads will be stopped at the end of the body. With
    <code>:stop</code>, they will first finish their current task (if
    any), with <code>:destroy</code>, they will be brutally destroyed
    and might leak resources, leave stuff in inconsistent state,
    etcetera. <code>worker-environment</code> can be used to give the
    workers in the local pool a specific dynamic <a
    href="#set-worker-environment">environment</a>.</p>
